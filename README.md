# lantern_ana

Package for analyzing Lantern ntuple files.

This package depends on libraries collected in the [ubdl repository](https://github.com/larbys/ubdl).
These must be built and environment variables set for the `lantern_ana` functions to work.
Follow the ubdl repository for build instructions.
A more convenient alternative is to use `lantern_ana` while running inside a docker or singularity container with the ubdl installed.

For information on the ROOT tree within the ntuple file see the [gen2ntuple](https://github.com/NuTufts/gen2ntuple/).

We also aim to provide tools to look at quantities from the upstream reconstruction chain or low-level truth information.
